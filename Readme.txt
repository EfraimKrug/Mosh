This is a project for scheduling moshgichim for
the MIT Kosher kitchen. The schedule will be as
self-maintaining as possible - and it will take
control of e-mailing (and possibly texting) for
the scheduling work. 

It is written modularly in PHP and HTML. There is
also some jQuery and JavaScript for fun...
